## Features

Key learnings from the project:

- Red-Green-Refactor Cycle: Learned to write failing tests (Red), write minimal code to pass the tests (Green), and then refactor the code for optimization and readability.
- Mocha & Chai: Gained hands-on experience with Mocha as a testing framework and Chai as an assertion library, including Chaiâ€™s expect and should styles.
- Chai Spies: Learned to use Chai Spies for tracking function calls, which is crucial for testing callback functions.
- Testing JavaScript Classes: Practiced writing tests for JavaScript classes, including instance methods and static methods.
- Error Handling: Learned to write tests that expect errors to be thrown under certain conditions.
